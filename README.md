**Hello!** :wave:

üè´ I'm a current PhD Student in Organizational Psychology at Columbia University with interests in quantitative methods.

:mag: I have two active areas of research. On one project, I am researching social and organizational factors that impact employee motivation. Separately, I'm conducting applied research on the use of text mining techniques for organizational research.
